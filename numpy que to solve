NumPy Roadmap for ML Engineering
1. Arrays & Basics (Creation, Shapes, Indexing, Slicing)
ðŸ‘‰ Used everywhere in ML (datasets are arrays).
Basic:
â€¢	Create a 1D, 2D, and 3D NumPy array. Print their shapes.
â€¢	Create an array of numbers from 0 to 20 with step size 2.
â€¢	Slice the above array to get only even numbers.
â€¢	Create a 3x3 matrix and extract the 2nd row and 3rd column.
Intermediate:
â€¢	Create a 5x5 identity matrix.
â€¢	Reshape an array of 25 numbers into a 5x5 matrix.
â€¢	Reverse an array without using loops.
Advanced:
â€¢	Given a 6x6 matrix, extract the inner 4x4 submatrix.
â€¢	Write code to flatten any n-dimensional array into 1D.

2. Array Operations (Math, Broadcasting, Aggregations)
ðŸ‘‰ Used in ML for vectorized operations instead of loops.
Basic:
â€¢	Perform element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, division on two arrays.
â€¢	Calculate mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of an array.
Intermediate:
â€¢	Given two arrays of shapes (3,1) and (1,3), perform broadcasting addition.
â€¢	Normalize an array (scale values between 0 and 1).
Advanced:
â€¢	Implement z-score normalization manually using NumPy.
â€¢	Compute pairwise Euclidean distance between rows of a 2D array.

3. Boolean Indexing & Filtering
ðŸ‘‰ Used to filter datasets based on conditions.
Basic:
â€¢	From an array of numbers 0â€“50, extract only multiples of 5.
â€¢	Given a 1D array, replace all negative numbers with 0.
Intermediate:
â€¢	From a 2D matrix, select all elements greater than the mean.
â€¢	Replace all odd numbers in an array with -1.
Advanced:
â€¢	Implement a function that filters outliers (values more than 2 std deviations from mean).
â€¢	From a random dataset, extract the top 5% of values.

4. Random Number Generation
ðŸ‘‰ Used to simulate datasets, initialize ML weights.
Basic:
â€¢	Generate 10 random integers between 1 and 100.
â€¢	Generate a 3x3 matrix of random floats between 0 and 1.
Intermediate:
â€¢	Generate a 1D array of 1000 random numbers and plot their histogram (check normal distribution).
â€¢	Set a random seed and show reproducibility.
Advanced:
â€¢	Create a random dataset of shape (1000,5) representing 1000 samples with 5 features.
â€¢	Simulate a biased coin toss (70% heads, 30% tails) 1000 times and calculate the probability.

5. Linear Algebra (Dot Product, Matrix Operations, Eigenvalues)
ðŸ‘‰ The heart of ML (used in regression, PCA, neural nets).
Basic:
â€¢	Compute the dot product of two vectors.
â€¢	Multiply two matrices.
Intermediate:
â€¢	Compute the inverse and determinant of a matrix.
â€¢	Solve a system of linear equations using np.linalg.solve.
Advanced:
â€¢	Compute eigenvalues & eigenvectors of a matrix.
â€¢	Implement a function to compute cosine similarity between two vectors.
